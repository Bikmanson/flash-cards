read about hashing of password
    what type in db
    how to hash it in model
    how to realize validatePassword function

create migration create_user_table
    'id'
    'username'
    'password' - hashed
    'authKey'

create class Player extends ActiveRecord implements IdentityInterface
    public id
    public username
    public password
    public authKey

realize interfaces methods in class Player (password has to be hashed)

realize in class Player methods needed for LoginForm

create actionSignUp in SiteController (using LoginForm if it fits)

change user component class to Player in config

__________________________DONE__________________________

add button sign up to header of start view

realize the access to card of play actions only for logined players

create migration add_player_username_column_card_table

add attribute playerUser to Card model

in new card form add activeHiddenInput with username

edit actions in CardController (maybe with new todo_list)
    new
    edit
    (maybe other)

edit actions in PlayController (maybe with new todo_list)

look at the result, debug and refactor farther :)
